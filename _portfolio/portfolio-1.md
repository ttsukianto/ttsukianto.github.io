title: "Neural likelihood for irregular spatial data via graph neural networks (GNNs)"
excerpt: Directly estimating a statistical model's likelihood function can be computationally intensive or even intractable for large spatial datasets such as those commonly found in the environmental sciences. As a part of my Ph.D thesis, I am applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the likelihood for our <a href='../files/paper1.pdf'>locally stationary Gaussian process model</a> for ocean heat content. Please see <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/stamps/images/stamps_poster_sukianto.pdf'>my recent poster</a> for more details.<br/><img src='/images/surfaces_example.png'> (Figure - Example likelihood surfaces for an isotropic Gaussian process. The GNN used to produce the neural surface was trained on actual Argo float sampling patterns.)
