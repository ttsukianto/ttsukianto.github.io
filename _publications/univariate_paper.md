**Abstract:** Argo profiling floats measure seawater temperature and salinity in the upper 2000
meters of the ocean. These floats are uniquely capable of measuring the global Ocean Heat Content
(OHC), a quantity that is of central importance for understanding Earth Energy Imbalance. Yet,
producing Argo-based OHC estimates with reliable uncertainties is statistically challenging due
to the complex structure and large size of the Argo dataset. Here we present an end-to-end
mapping and uncertainty quantification framework for Argo-based OHC estimation using state-of-
the-art methods from spatio-temporal statistics. The framework is based on modeling vertically
integrated Argo temperature profiles as a locally stationary Gaussian process defined over space
and time. This enables us to produce computationally tractable OHC anomaly maps based on
data-driven decorrelation scales estimated from the Argo observations. Our modeling choices
are validated using statistical cross-validation, which demonstrates the importance of including a
climatological time trend in the mean field and accounting for time in the covariance function.
We quantify the uncertainty of these maps using local conditional simulation ensembles, a novel
approach that leads to principled spatially and temporally correlated uncertainty quantification. A
new paired cross-validation technique is presented to validate these uncertainties. The mapping
framework is implemented in an open-source codebase that is designed to be modular, reproducible
and extensible. To demonstrate the mapping and uncertainty quantification capabilities of this
approach, we present new Argo OHC maps with uncertainties for 2004–2022 and report on various
downstream climatological estimates and their uncertainties.
