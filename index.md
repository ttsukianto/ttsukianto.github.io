## About

I am a first year PhD student at the [Carnegie Mellon University Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/) where I am a member of the [Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/research/group/stamps) group currently working with [Mikael Kuusela](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~mkuusela/) and [Donata Giglio](https://www.colorado.edu/atoc/donata-giglio-sheherhers) on improved uncertainty quantification for ocean heat content.

### Interests

- Statistics in the physical sciences
- Methods for spatio-temporal data
- Uncertainty quantification
- Statistical computing

### Research

While pursuing a BS in Applied Mathematics at Boise State University (2018-21):
