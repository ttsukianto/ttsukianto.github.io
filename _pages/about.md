I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Mikael Kuusela](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~mkuusela/). My current research focuses on rigorous uncertainty quantification and neural simulation-based inference for large and complex spatio-temporal data. 

In collaboration with [Prof. Donata Giglio](https://sites.google.com/site/donatagiglio/) (CU Boulder), I have worked on a mapping and uncertainty quantification framework for ocean heat content from Argo floats. Through this work, I am involved in a number of climatological intercomparison efforts (see my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jU2_lmsAAAAJ&hl=en) page). 

Since 2024, I have served as coordinator for the [Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences (STAMPS)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/stamps/index.html) Research Center. Please see the link for information on our work and upcoming events.
